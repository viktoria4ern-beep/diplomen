                <h2 class="mbr-section-subtitle mbr-fonts-style mb-3 display-2">The luxury world was rocked when TikTok creator @mangomoniica (Monica Hamada) exposed her $10,000 Van Cleef &amp; Arpels Alhambra bracelet tarnishing after just two months of wear—and the brand's shocking response. What began as a personal disappointment snowballed into a viral reckoning about luxury's broken promises. Here's the full breakdown of the scandal that's making Gen Z rethink their Van Cleef and Aprels obsessions.</h2>

</div><div>Monica Hamada posted a video to her TikTok account claiming she contacted Van Cleef &amp; Arpels’ after noticing some discolouration on her expensive jewellery item.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The Hawaiian based beauty content creator claims she was initially refused a complimentary replacement or a refund for her VCA item, who responded to her complaint saying the tarnished area was just her “finger reflection”.</div><br><div>
</div><div>Van Cleef &amp; Arpels’ has developed somewhat of a cult status among Gen Zers, with the brand’s iconic four-leaf clover motif proving a huge hit among TikTokers.</div><br><div>
</div><div>The influencer said she chose the special piece to commemorate a career milestone, and after a lot of thought, decided the Vintage Alhambra bracelet in 18K yellow gold would be her choice.</div><br><div>
</div><div>However, this would become one of her most regretful purchases, after what she claims was a lengthy process of disappointing customer service and constant delays.</div><div>

                <h4 class="mbr-section-subtitle align-center mbr-fonts-style mb-4 display-4"><div>After being told she had to wait multiple months after initially paying for the bracelet to actually hold it in her hands – because the Van Cleef boutique in Hawaii where she lives doesn’t actually stock the items for purchase in store – Ms Hamada says she wore the bracelet for two months before she started noticing the discolouration.</div><br><div>
</div><div>After first reporting the “tarnish” on the 2nd of December 2024, VCA agreed for the bracelet to be returned to her local boutique, where they used an ultrasonic cleaner on the item, however that did not resolve the issue.</div><br><div>
</div><div>“I still could see a little bit of tarnishing right after she did the ultrasonic cleaner,” Ms Hamada told.</div><br><div>“So [the VCA representative] told me that I could come back the very next day and get it cleaned again.
</div><div>
</div><div><br></div>“So, literally the very next day, I got it cleaned again.”<div><br></div><div>However, the “tarnish” remained and Ms Hamada said she was told to wait until after the holidays to send her bracelet to New York City for a professional clean as “it’s going to get pushed back and take a very long time.”</div><div><br></div><div>So Ms Hamada waited until the 1st of March to finally drop the bracelet off to be sent to NYC for “professional” repolishing – the results of which were ineffective.</div><div><br></div><div>When Ms Hamada reported the “tarnish” was still there, she said felt she was being gaslit by the store manager.</div><div><br></div><div>“The sales associate said that she couldn’t see it … but then the male sales associate said he could see it,” the influencer said.</div><div><br></div><div>“She was basically saying, no, that’s your finger reflection.</div><div><br></div><div>“She was being so rude to me … she didn’t want me to even be in the store.”</div><div><br></div><div><div>Ms Hamada said it was this lack of accountability that frustrated her the most.
</div><div>“Oh my gosh, it felt terrible. I literally thought I was blind,” she said.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>“I was like, am I seeing things?</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>“I don’t like voicing my concern, but then … I’m spending $6,000 (USD) on this bracelet.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>“It was horrible”.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>Ms Hamada was presented with two options: get it repolished again, or pay to get the “tarnished” motif replaced, both of which she found unacceptable.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>Ms Hamada’s original TikTok video has amassed over 6 million views.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>Ms Hamada said she did not want to have to post a negative review, but felt she needed to so she could raise awareness before others decided to splurge on such an expensive item.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>“I do not even want to be posting about this.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>“It’s so unprofessional for me too because I’m a beauty creator, I work with these huge brands and they’re watching my stuff</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>“I feel bad that I’m dissing a huge brand while I have all these big sponsorships going on right now.”</div></div><br><div><div>

</div><div>“Girl even my dupe doesn’t tarnish,” one follower pointed out.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>“I would go bananas. The bracelet costs 100 to make so they should give you a new one or refund,” US TV personality Bethenny Frankel posted.</div></div><br><div><div>

</div><div>After multiple viral videos posted by the influencer, VCA corporate informed Ms Hamada of a final outcome – they will provide her with a refund.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>“I’m happy that they are refunding me because they normally don’t refund customers after 30 days.</div></div><br><div><div>
</div><div>“But I also wanted to make it clear to corporate that I did not want to receive the refund. All I wanted that day was for them just to help me fix the tarnish.”</div></div><br><div><div>

<br>
<br>“To be honest, I just wanted the manager to apologise for her actions, for being very rude.
<br>
<br>“She could have just said, I had a bad day. I’m so sorry that I treated you like that.
<br>
<br>“The corporate lady was apologising on behalf of the manager … I want her to apologise, she was the one that was being mean.
<br>
<br>“That’s the least I feel like I could get. It’s just an apology. It doesn’t take long just to say that you’re sorry.”
<br>
<br>Ms Hamada was surprised her video resonated with so many people as she was afraid people would think it was just “first world problems”.
<br>
<br>“I think a lot of people too, like they try to save money just like me, they want a jewellery piece like Van Cleef one day if they have the means to afford it.”</p>
